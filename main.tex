This electronic document is a ÒliveÓ template. The various components of your paper [title, text, heads, etc.] are already defined on the style sheet, as illustrated by the portions given in this document

\end{abstract}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
{\LARGE THIS IS DUMMY TEXT}%

This template, modified in MS Word 2003 and saved as ÒWord 97-2003 \& 6.0/95 Ð RTFÓ for the PC, provides authors with most of the formatting specifications needed for preparing electronic versions of their papers. All standard paper components have been specified for three reasons: (1) ease of use when formatting individual papers, (2) automatic compliance to electronic requirements that facilitate the concurrent or later production of electronic products, and (3) conformity of style throughout a conference proceedings. Margins, column widths, line spacing, and type styles are built-in; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document and are identified in italic type, within parentheses, following the example. Some components, such as multi-leveled equations, graphics, and tables are not prescribed, although the various table text styles are provided. The formatter will need to create these components, incorporating the applicable criteria that follow.

\subsection{Dummy text 1}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. Please do not use it for A4 paper since the margin requirements for A4 papers may be different from Letter paper size.

\subsection{Dummy text 2}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{PRESERVATION OF TRANSACTION PRIVACY}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Blockchain analysis} %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Privacy-enhancing overlays in bitcoin
        \item An analysis of anonymity in bitcoin using P2P network traffic
        \item An analysis of anonymity in bitcoin using P2P network traffic
        \item Quantitative analysis of the full Bitcoin transaction graph
        \item Bitcoin over Tor isn\'t a good idea.
    \end{itemize}}
    
    
    
    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Method of enhancing privacy and anonymity}
\subsubsection{Technologies based on P2P model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item coinjoin
        \item coinshuffle
        \item P2P Mxing and unlinkable payment hub
        \item Sybil-Resistant Mixing for Bitcoin
        \item coinparty
        \item valueshuffle
    \end{itemize}
    
    
    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Technologies based on overlay model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item mixCoin
        \item blindCoin
        \item Blindly signed contracts: Anonymous on-blockchain and off-blockchain bitcoin transactions
        \item  TumbleBit
        \item Bolt: Anonymous Payment Channels for Decentralized Currencies
    \end{itemize}
    

%\begin{itemize}

%\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units %may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English %units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
%\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in %oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If %you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an %equation.
%\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per %square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few %henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
%\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

\section*{APPENDIX}

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

The preferred spelling of the word ÒacknowledgmentÓ in America is without an ÒeÓ after the ÒgÓ. Avoid the stilted expression, ÒOne of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .Ó  Instead, try ÒR. B. G. thanksÓ. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. If at all possible, references should be commonly available publications.
